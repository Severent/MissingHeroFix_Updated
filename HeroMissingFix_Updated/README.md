MissingHeroFix_Updated

This is a simple Mount and Blade Bannerlord mod that looks for inactive heros that are still alive and in some 
cases clan leaders and re-enables them. While the lords were inactive, players were not able to interact with 
them and they did not lead armies.

Works with e1.6.5 of Bannerlord, but should hopefully not take much to support. 
Also it should be safe to add and remove mod from saved games since it does not modify any save data directly.
